# Security Policy

This document provides guidelines to ensure the security and integrity of our project.

## Introduction

We have established this security policy to outline our procedures for reporting vulnerabilities and safeguarding the project.

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest release of the project. Please refer to the most recent release for updated security protocols.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value your contributions to our community's security. To report vulnerabilities, please follow the steps below:

### Steps for Reporting

1. **Confidentiality**  
Do not publicly disclose any details regarding the vulnerability until it has been fully resolved and a patch is released. Premature disclosure could expose users to potential risks.

2. **Visit Security Advisories**  
Begin the reporting process by navigating to our [Security Advisories page][security-advisories-page].

3. **Submit a New Advisory**  
Create a new Security Advisory, providing detailed information, including reproduction steps (if applicable). Comprehensive reports help us address issues more efficiently.

This process is strictly for security-related vulnerabilities. For non-security bugs, please visit our [Bug reports page][bug-reports-page].

## Our Response Process

After receiving your report, our security team will:

- Acknowledge your report within 72 hours.
- Provide an estimated timeline for investigation and resolution.
- Diligently verify and resolve the issue.
- Keep you updated throughout the process.

## Questions

For any questions or further clarification, feel free to join our [Questions page][questions-page].
